**Diageo plc (DGE) Financial Analysis - September 5, 2025**

An in-depth fundamental analysis of Diageo plc, based on its latest financial year 2025 results, indicates a company with robust profitability and strong cash flow generation, facing some headwinds but maintaining a commitment to shareholder returns. The current share price of £21.30 presents a potential entry point for long-term dividend-growth investors, with the intrinsic value estimated to be significantly higher.

**Executive Summary:**

Diageo's financial performance in fiscal year 2025 demonstrates resilience in a challenging market. While profitability metrics such as Return on Equity and Return on Invested Capital remain strong and above the desired thresholds, the company's financial health shows a relatively high debt-to-equity ratio, which warrants monitoring. Dividend coverage remains healthy, supported by strong free cash flow. Based on a conservative Dividend Discount Model and an Asset-Based Valuation, the intrinsic value of Diageo shares is estimated to be in the range of £26.96 to £31.22. Applying a 20-30% margin of safety suggests a "Buy" price range of £18.87 to £25.00. The current price of £21.30 falls within this attractive accumulation zone.

**Recommendation:**

**BUY**

Given the current share price of £21.30 is below our estimated intrinsic value range and within the suggested margin of safety buy zone, Diageo presents an attractive opportunity for long-term dividend-growth investors. The company's strong brand portfolio, consistent profitability, and commitment to shareholder returns outweigh the current concerns over its leverage and short-term ROIC underperformance. The significant discount to its 1000-day moving average further supports the case for accumulation at these levels.

**Target Buy Price: £18.87 - £25.00**
