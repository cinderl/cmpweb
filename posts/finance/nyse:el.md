### **Valuation & Entry Price**

**1. Asset-Based Valuation (Book Value)**
* Total Assets (FY 2025): $\$19.89B$
* Total Liabilities (FY 2025): $\$16.03B$
* Total Common Shares Outstanding (FY 2025): $359.77M$
* $$\text{Intrinsic Value (Per Share)} = \frac{\text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$
* $$\text{Intrinsic Value (Per Share)} = \frac{\$19.89B - \$16.03B}{359.77M} \approx \$10.73$$
* **Price/Book (P/B):** $\frac{\$83.19}{\$10.73} \approx 7.75$. This is high; the stock is trading at a significant premium to its book value.

**2. Dividend Discount Model (DDM)**
* The recent dividend cut (from $\$0.66$ to $\$0.35$ per quarter) makes DDM very unreliable. The assumption of stable, predictable growth has been broken.
* *Estimate D1:* Annual Dividend $\approx \$1.40$
* *Required Rate of Return (r):* Let's estimate $r = 9\%$ (Typical for blue-chip stock)
* *Expected Dividend Growth Rate (g):* The company will need to stabilize. Given the cut, a very conservative long-term growth rate must be used. Let's assume a modest recovery and growth of $g = 3\%$ (lower than historical pre-cut CAGR).
* $$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \frac{\text{D1}}{\text{r} - \text{g}} = \frac{\$1.40}{0.09 - 0.03} = \frac{\$1.40}{0.06} \approx \$23.33$$
* **DDM Intrinsic Value:** $\approx \$23.33$ (Highly sensitive to $g$ and $r$ and questionable given the dividend cut).

**Conclusion on Intrinsic Value:**
The Asset-Based Value ($\approx \$10.73$) is very low, as it's a brand-driven company whose value is mostly intangible (not captured in book value). The DDM Value ($\approx \$23.33$) is also very low and unreliable due to the dividend cut and poor recent performance. The current GAAP profitability is negative, making DCF challenging.
Given the severe drop in earnings and the recent dividend cut, the company is facing significant operational headwinds (especially in Travel Retail) and is priced for a major rebound that is not yet visible in the financials. The market is pricing in a return to historical profitability, but this is a high-risk bet.

**Target Buy Price (Based on DDM as a theoretical floor, not a robust estimate):**
Using DDM of $\$23.33$ and a $30\%$ Margin of Safety is not meaningful due to the company's current financial distress and the failure of the dividend-growth model. A technical analysis approach is more appropriate at this time.

**3. Technical Check - 1000-Day Moving Average (1000DMA)**
* The 1000-Day Moving Average is not explicitly provided, but the **200-Day Moving Average (200DMA)** is $\approx \$75.23$.
* The current price ($\$83.19$) is above the 200DMA. Given the severity of the financial deterioration, the current price is far from an "accumulation zone" based on long-term averages.

### **Key Strengths and Risks**

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Strengths** | **Gross Margin:** Excellent gross margin ($74.0\%$) indicating strong brand value and pricing power. **Liquidity:** Current Ratio is healthy at $1.30$. **Positive Free Cash Flow:** Despite a GAAP net loss, the company generated positive FCF ($\$670M$), suggesting non-cash items (like impairment charges) severely affected net income. |
| **Risks** | **Profitability:** Negative Net Income, Net Margin, ROE, and Operating Margin (FY 2025). **Dividend Sustainability:** Payout Ratio is $92.2\%$ of FCF, and the dividend was cut in 2024, removing its dividend growth status. **Financial Leverage:** Debt/Equity of $1.89$ is high, and Total Debt/FCF is too high at $13.84$. **Operational Headwinds:** The significant revenue decline ($-8\%$) and impairment charges point to severe and ongoing business challenges, particularly in the critical Asia/Travel Retail segment. **Valuation:** The stock trades at a very high multiple to its book value and is not supported by current earnings. |

### **Recommendation**

**Recommendation: AVOID**

**Rationale:**
As a financial expert specialized in **fundamental analysis and dividend-growth investing**, EL currently fails to meet almost all key criteria.
1.  **Profitability** is severely compromised, with a Net Loss in FY 2025 and poor capital returns (ROE, ROIC).
2.  **Financial Health** is acceptable for liquidity (Current Ratio), but **leverage is too high** (Debt/Equity $\approx 1.89$, Debt/FCF $\approx 13.84$).
3.  **Dividend Sustainability** is broken. The recent dividend cut disqualifies it from the "consistent dividend growth" mandate, and the FCF Payout Ratio is unsustainably high at $92.2\%$.
The stock is currently a **turnaround play**, relying solely on the market's belief in a return to former glory. This type of high-risk, negative-earnings speculation is contrary to the principles of fundamental and dividend-growth investing. An investor should wait for clear, sustained evidence of operational and financial recovery before considering a position.
