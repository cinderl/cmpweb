# Markdown Showcase with Internet Images

> A compact file demonstrating many Markdown features **plus** working links to images on the web.

## 1. Headings & Emphasis

# H1 — Title

## H2 — Section

### H3 — Subsection

You can use *italic*, **bold**, or ***both***.  `Inline code` works too.

## 7. Table

| Column A     |      Column B | Notes       |
| ------------ | ------------: | ----------- |
| Left aligned | Right aligned | basic table |
| `code`       |      **bold** | *italic*    |

---

## 8. Blockquote and Footnote

> This is a blockquote. Use it for notable text, citations or emphasis.

Here's a footnote example[^1].

[^1]: Footnote text — great for references or short citations.

---

## 9. Inline HTML (works in many Markdown renderers)

<div>
  <strong>HTML block:</strong> You can include raw HTML for advanced layout.
</div>

---

## 10. Math (LaTeX) — many renderers support it

Inline math: \$E = mc^2\$
Display math:

$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}$

---

## 11. Emojis & Special

* Emoji: \:rocket: \:camera: \:mountain:
* Horizontal rule above separates sections.

---

## 12. Next steps (suggested)

1. Tell me which images you want as *direct image files* (I’ll fetch exact URLs).
2. I can produce a cleaned `.md` ready for GitHub README or a printable PDF.

*File generated for you — rename or copy as needed.*
